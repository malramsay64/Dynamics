Analysis of LAAMPS Files
========================

I have now completed most of the requirements for the analysis of a lammpstrj file.
This is important because the tool can now be useful to other people in the group
since basically everyone else uses lammps.
This is a rudimentary tool, although it should at least work.
Since I am dealing with strings there is not a whole lot
in the way of performance optimisations,
or at least any that I am aware of.

Features that are still required for the analyses I will need to do
are the computation of dynamics for the different types of particles.
Although this could only require adding the type to the resulting DataFrame,
something which would be really convenient.

Before I merge the branch into master,
I would like to test the analysis on a proper input file,
I should be able to get one from Alex for testing.
