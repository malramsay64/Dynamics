Data Storage
============

The storage of results in a sensible fashion is something I am still working out.
There are a few stages of data analysis that I am going to have,
1) raw data -> the data straight from the simulations
2) Computed dynamics quantities -> quantities computed directly
    a) Molecular relaxation quantities -> relaxation times for every molecule
3) Aggregated dynamics quantities -> Taking the mean and standard deviation of 2)
4) Relaxation quantities -> single value representation of dynamics
    a) Aggregated molecular relaxations -> molecular relaxation times
I would like to include all values 2), 3) and 4) in a single file
so that everything is in a single location,
then have an additional file with just the values for 4)
so that there is a small file with all the important values contained within.

Layout
------

Dynamics
├── data
│   ├── computed
│   │   ├── dynamics.h5
│   │   │   ├── raw/
│   │   │   ├── aggregated
│   │   │   ├── single_molecule/
│   │   │   └── relaxation
│   │   └── relaxations.h5
│   │       └── relaxation
│   └── simulations
│       └── 2017-09-09-dynamics

The idea for the layout of the data is shown above,
with the computed folder containing both the dynamics.h5 and relaxations.h5 files.
For the raw and single_molecule components,
I am expecting that each set of simulation parameters
will have their own dataset,
while the rest will be datasets containing all values in wide format.
So the aggregated table will look something like

    Temp | Pressure | Time | MSD | Struct | rot_1 | ...
     1.5 |   13.50  |   0  |   0 |   1    |   1   | ....
     .
     .
     .

The relaxations file will be a copy of the relaxation dataset but in a format
which is easier for sharing since it is smaller.
Any additional data that needs to be computed like for
the investigation of Stokes-Einstein breakdown
can be included in the computed folder.
