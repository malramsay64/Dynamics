# Dynamics Results

The results for the dynamics with P=13.50 T=1.40 were very unusual,
being very similar to the results at T=1.45.
I would conclude from this that
the equilibration of the initial configurations was not sufficient
with the dynamics at short timescales
not being representative of the particular temperature they were run at.

As a solution to this
I have taken the final configuration from the 'production' run,
and used it as the starting configuration for a new production run
for all the simulation conditions.
This will hopefully fix this particular issue
so I can move on to calculating derived quantities.

At this stage I haven't updated the experiment definition to fix this issue,
should the additional equilibration be the solution
I will update the experiment file to allow for this.
