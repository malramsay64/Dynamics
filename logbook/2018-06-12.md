Short Codes
===========

I think the short codes for git commits are really useful for code, although I think there need to be some adjustments made for this data analysis type repository. The short codes for numpy are;

- API: an (incompatible) API change
- BLD: change related to building numpy
- BUG: bug fix
- DEP: deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
- DEV: development tool or utility
- DOC: documentation
- ENH: enhancement
- MAINT: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.)
- REV: revert an earlier commit
- STY: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
- TST: addition or modification of tests
- REL: related to releasing numpy

There are a few of these that are probably unnecessary, and I likely need a couple of others.
The list below is the set of codes I am thinking I should be using within the repository.

- EXP: Update or include new experiment.
- ENV: Change environment
- NB: Update data analysis notebooks
- BUG: bug fix
- DOC: documentation
- ENH: enhancement
- MAINT: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.)
- REV: revert an earlier commit
- STY: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
- TST: addition or modification of tests


These codes are subject to change, since I am still working on this, however I really think that this will make it easier to work out what each commit contains. Additionally it helps to make the commits atomic.
