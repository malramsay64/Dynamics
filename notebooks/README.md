# Notebooks

This is a collection of notebooks 
primarily focused on the interactive analysis of 
the dynamics results.
There are a number of differing levels of analysis 
which are indicated by the numbering scheme.

- 0*-<name>: These notebooks are preliminary analysis, there are no results in these
  notebooks and these are more checks that simulations are working properly
- 1*-<name>: The 1 series of notebooks are a collection of notebooks with investigative
  results. Typically the notebook is pursuing a single idea with a number of results
  supporting that.
- 2*-<name>: These are final results, whether creating figures for publication or to
  publish a narrative supported by the data.

The second digit of the number is a guide to the order in which the notebooks should be
viewed in, with the numbering often having dependencies of ideas and building upon the
results of the previous notebooks. This said all notebooks are designed to be self
contained, where there is code or analysis that can/should be shared between the
notebooks it should be moved to the project `src` directory for import into each
notebook.
